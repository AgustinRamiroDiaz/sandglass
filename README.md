# Sandglass Timer ‚è≥

A sleek, mobile-focused timer application with a unique flip mechanic, originally designed for the board game **Magic Maze**.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Flip Timer**: Click the timer display to flip it, swapping remaining time with elapsed time - just like flipping a physical sandglass
- **Visual Feedback**: Timer color gradually transitions from green to red as time runs out
- **Preset Durations**: Quick access to 1, 3, 5, and 10-minute timers
- **Custom Durations**: Set any custom duration in minutes

### Sound Alerts
- **Configurable Time Alerts**: Add custom sound alerts at any time interval (e.g., 30s, 15s, 5s)
- **Finish Alert**: Optional sound notification when timer completes
- **Master Control**: Enable/disable all sounds with a single toggle

### User Experience
- **Persistent Settings**: All configurations saved to localStorage
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Large touch targets and responsive design
- **Dark Mode Support**: Seamless light/dark theme support
- **Minimal Interface**: Clean UI with configuration tucked away in a modal

## üéÆ Magic Maze Connection

This timer was originally designed for the cooperative board game [Magic Maze](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209778/magic-maze), which uses a sandglass timer as a core game mechanic. Players can flip the sandglass to add more time, and this app replicates that experience digitally with added customization options.
